                      Before focusing on fixtures, consider what parts of your outdoor space you want to highlight at
                      night. Whether it's architectural features, garden elements, or creating a sense of security,
                      start by asking yourself what's most important.

                      Landscape lighting isn't just about brightnessâ€”it's about creating ambiance. Consider how you want
                      to feel about the space once it's lit. Lighting can transform your home's exterior into a
                      welcoming and dramatic scene without making it look like a floodlit stadium.
